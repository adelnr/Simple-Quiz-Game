# Simple Quiz Game

One of my first projects in Python.
This Python program is a simple quiz game that tests your knowledge with multiple-choice questions. It asks a series of questions and provides feedback based on the user's answers. 

## Usage

1. Run the `quiz_game.py` script.

2. The program will display a welcome message and prompt you to enter your name and age.

3. If your age is 8, 9, or 10, the game will start; otherwise, it will indicate that the game is not suitable for your age and exit.

4. The game will ask a series of questions, and you need to input your answers.

5. After each question, the program will provide feedback on whether your answer was correct or incorrect.

6. At the end of the game, the program will display your score.
